This is the server Java application of the Wireless TouchPad.

This application was developed as a part of the Firefox OS hackathon in IIT Bombay held on 25-26 June, 2014. 

For running the server, in terminal window/command promp navigate to the project folder and run `java Main`. 

NOTE: Both the server and client machines should be connected to the same wireless network. Because of the multiple AJAX GET calls there may be considerable lags in the muse movement according to the network traffic. We are working on an alternate solution for reducing this lag.
